* Complicated code: explain what you are doing so that others can understand.

## Variables

### Primitive types

There are two types of variables in Java: objects of a class and primitive types:

The primitive types:

boolean: true, false . . . represented by the Boolean wrapper class.
char: 'A', '%', '.' . . . represented by the Character wrapper class.
int: 32, -1280, 777 . . . represented by the Integer wrapper class.
double: 32, 3.5433, -5433.54 . . . represented by the Double wrapper class.

*char is stored in the computer as an ASCII value taking up 8 bytes, which can also be represented in numerical form:

'A' = 65
'A' + 2 = 67

In Java, we convert primitive types into their **wrapper classes** when needed. This wrapper class holds the primitive type but also provides some methods for convenience. Converting between primitive types and wrapper types is called "autoboxing/unboxing".

### Declaring variables

Declare: `int age;`
Initialize and declare: `int age = 17;`

### String concatonation

"String" + number + "squish" = "String<number>squish"
