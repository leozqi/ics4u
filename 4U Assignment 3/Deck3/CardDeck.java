 * 4U Assignment 3, Question 3
 *
 * By Leo Qi: 2021-10-27
 *
 * This program provides the "CardDeck" public class to simulate a standard deck
 * of cards, and three methods, shuffle, Deal, and toString, for question 3.
 *
 * The methods that answer question 3 are the instance method shuffle(), the
 * STATIC toString method, and the Deal() instance method.
 *
 * Everything is implemented with Java arrays, ArrayList, and the java.util.Arrays
 * class.

import java.util.*;

/**
 * Simulates a playing card deck with 52 cards in four suits.
 *
 * There are four cards of each type in four suits: spades, hearts, diamonds,
 * and clubs. The types are "Ace", 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen and
 * King.
 *
 * When an object of this class is initialized, it will automatically have cards in
 * order from Ace to numbered cards to face cards, from suit Spades to Hearts to
 * Diamonds to Clubs.
 *
 * Public instance methods this class provides:
 *
 *    * `void shuffle()`: shuffles all the cards into a new random order.
 *
 *    * `String toString()`: Displays the entire deck in its current state, whether
 *      shuffled or not.
 *
 *    * `void Deal(int handSize (optional), boolean showSymbols (optional))`:
 *      Deals out handSize cards to two hands and prints them on the screen.
 *        * handSize: how many cards to deal to each of the two hands. 5 is default.
 *          If handSize is greater than can be dealt with the deck's cards, an error
 *          will be printed out. `false` is default.
 *        * showSymbols: If showSymbols is set to true, will show Unicode card symbols.
 *          when displaying each hand.
 *          This is not the default because some terminals do not support displaying
 *          these playing card characters, but can be called on a terminal that
 *          supports it like Replit's online Java terminal.
 *
 * Static methods this class provides:
 *
 *    * `static String toString(CardDeck d)`: same as toString but shuffles first.
 *      Takes a CardDeck instance as input, shuffles it, and then displays its
 *      new shuffled order.
