Class: identification of things that all share the same attributes
Class examples: Cars, People, Food, Dogs

Methods: are things the items in the class DO:

Cars.Drive()
people.Talk()

Our example:

```java
Scanner stdin = new Scanner(system.in);
int a  = stdin.nextInt();
```

* Scanner is the name of the class
* stdin is the object IN that class
* stdin.nextInt() is the method we used

parameters: is a fancy word for the variables we put into a function or class

ex: pythagoreanTheorem(int a, int b): a and b are parameters.

## Shallow and deep copies

| 3 | -> If 3 is stored in a variable, and I set another variable to POINT at that location, that is a shallow copy.

If I made another variable in a different location with the value of 3, that is a deep copy.
